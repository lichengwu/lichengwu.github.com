CMS GC with -XX:+PrintGCDetails and -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps prints a lot
of information. Understanding this information can help in fine tuning
various parameters of the application and CMS to achieve best
performance.

Let's have a look at some of the CMS logs generated with 1.4.2\_10:

**39.910: [GC 39.910: [ParNew: 261760K-\>0K(261952K), 0.2314667 secs]
262017K-\>26386K(1048384K), 0.2318679 secs]**

Young generation (ParNew) collection. Young generation capacity is
261952K and after the collection its occupancy drops down from 261760K
to 0. This collection took 0.2318679 secs.

**40.146: [GC [1 CMS-initial-mark: 26386K(786432K)] 26404K(1048384K),
0.0074495 secs]**

Beginning of tenured generation collection with CMS collector. This is
initial Marking phase of CMS where all the objects directly reachable
from roots are marked and this is done with all the mutator threads
stopped.

Capacity of tenured generation space is 786432K and CMS was triggered at
the occupancy of 26386K.

**40.154: [CMS-concurrent-mark-start]**

Start of concurrent marking phase. 
 In Concurrent Marking phase, threads stopped in the first phase are
started again and all the objects transitively reachable from the
objects marked in first phase are marked here.

**40.683: [CMS-concurrent-mark: 0.521/0.529 secs]**

Concurrent marking took total 0.521 seconds cpu time and 0.529 seconds
wall time that includes the yield to other threads also.

**40.683: [CMS-concurrent-preclean-start]**

Start of precleaning. 
 Precleaning is also a concurrent phase. Here in this phase we look at
the objects in CMS heap which got updated by promotions from young
generation or new allocations or got updated by mutators while we were
doing the concurrent marking in the previous concurrent marking phase.
By rescanning those objects concurrently, the precleaning phase helps
reduce the work in the next stop-the-world “remark” phase.

**40.701: [CMS-concurrent-preclean: 0.017/0.018 secs]**

Concurrent precleaning took 0.017 secs total cpu time and 0.018 wall
time.

**40.704: [GC40.704: [Rescan (parallel) , 0.1790103 secs]40.883: [weak
refs processing, 0.0100966 secs] [1 CMS-remark: 26386K(786432K)]
52644K(1048384K), 0.1897792 secs]**

Stop-the-world phase. This phase rescans any residual updated objects in
CMS heap, retraces from the roots and also processes Reference objects.
Here the rescanning work took 0.1790103 secs and weak reference objects
processing took 0.0100966 secs. This phase took total 0.1897792 secs to
complete.

**40.894: [CMS-concurrent-sweep-start]**

Start of sweeping of dead/non-marked objects. Sweeping is concurrent
phase performed with all other threads running.

**41.020: [CMS-concurrent-sweep: 0.126/0.126 secs]**

Sweeping took 0.126 secs.

**41.020: [CMS-concurrent-reset-start]**

Start of reset.

**41.147: [CMS-concurrent-reset: 0.127/0.127 secs]**

In this phase, the CMS data structures are reinitialized so that a new
cycle may begin at a later time. In this case, it took 0.127 secs.

This was how a normal CMS cycle runs. Now let us look at some other CMS
log entries:

**197.976: [GC 197.976: [ParNew: 260872K-\>260872K(261952K), 0.0000688
secs]197.976: [CMS197.981: [CMS-concurrent-sweep: 0.516/0.531 secs]
 (concurrent mode failure): 402978K-\>248977K(786432K), 2.3728734 secs]
663850K-\>248977K(1048384K), 2.3733725 secs]**

This shows that a ParNew collection was requested, but it was not
attempted because it was estimated that there was not enough space in
the CMS generation to promote the worst case surviving young generation
objects. We name this failure as “full promotion guarantee failure”.

Due to this, Concurrent Mode of CMS is interrupted and a Full GC is
invoked at 197.981. This mark-sweep-compact stop-the-world Full GC took
2.3733725 secs and the CMS generation space occupancy dropped from
402978K to 248977K.

The concurrent mode failure can either be avoided by increasing the
tenured generation size or initiating the CMS collection at a lesser
heap occupancy by setting CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction to a lower
value and setting UseCMSInitiatingOccupancyOnly to true. The value for
CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction should be chosen appropriately because
setting it to a very low value will result in too frequent CMS
collections.

Sometimes we see these promotion failures even when the logs show that
there is enough free space in tenured generation. The reason is
'fragmentation' - the free space available in tenured generation is not
contiguous, and promotions from young generation require a contiguous
free block to be available in tenured generation. CMS collector is a
non-compacting collector, so can cause fragmentation of space for some
type of applications. In his blog, Jon talks in detail on how to deal
with this fragmentation problem:
[http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonthecollector?entry=when\_the\_sum\_of\_the](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonthecollector?entry=when_the_sum_of_the)

Starting with 1.5, for the CMS collector, the promotion guarantee check
is done differently. Instead of assuming that the promotions would be
worst case i.e. all of the surviving young generation objects would get
promoted into old gen, the expected promotion is estimated based on
recent history of promotions. This estimation is usually much smaller
than the worst case promotion and hence requires less free space to be
available in old generation. And if the promotion in a scavenge attempt
fails, then the young generation is left in a consistent state and a
stop-the-world mark-compact collection is invoked. To get the same
functionality with UseSerialGC you need to explicitly specify the switch
-XX:+HandlePromotionFailure.

**283.736: [Full GC 283.736: [ParNew: 261599K-\>261599K(261952K),
0.0000615 secs] 826554K-\>826554K(1048384K), 0.0003259 secs]
 GC locker: Trying a full collection because scavenge failed
 283.736: [Full GC 283.736: [ParNew: 261599K-\>261599K(261952K),
0.0000288 secs]**

Stop-the-world GC happening when a JNI Critical section is released.
Here again the young generation collection failed due to “full promotion
guarantee failure” and then the Full GC is being invoked.

CMS can also be run in incremental mode (i-cms), enabled with
-XX:+CMSIncrementalMode. In this mode, CMS collector does not hold the
processor for the entire long concurrent phases but periodically stops
them and yields the processor back to other threads in application. It
divides the work to be done in concurrent phases in small chunks(called
duty cycle) and schedules them between minor collections. This is very
useful for applications that need low pause times and are run on
machines with small number of processors.

Some logs showing the incremental CMS.

**2803.125: [GC 2803.125: [ParNew: 408832K-\>0K(409216K), 0.5371950
secs] 611130K-\>206985K(1048192K) icms\_dc=4 , 0.5373720 secs]\
 2824.209: [GC 2824.209: [ParNew: 408832K-\>0K(409216K), 0.6755540 secs]
615806K-\>211897K(1048192K) icms\_dc=4 , 0.6757740 secs]**

Here, the scavenges took respectively 537 ms and 675 ms. In between
these two scavenges, iCMS ran for a brief period as indicated by the
icms\_dc value, which indicates a duty-cycle. In this case the duty
cycle was 4%. A simple calculation shows that the iCMS incremental step
lasted for 4/100  \* (2824.209 - 2803.125 - 0.537) = 821 ms, i.e. 4% of
the time between the two scavenges.

Starting with 1.5, CMS has one more phase – concurrent abortable
preclean. Abortable preclean is run between a 'concurrent preclean' and
'remark' until we have the desired occupancy in eden. This phase is
added to help schedule the 'remark' phase so as to avoid back-to-back
pauses for a scavenge closely followed by a CMS remark pause. In order
to maximally separate a scavenge from a CMS remark pause, we attempt to
schedule the CMS remark pause roughly mid-way between scavenges.

There is a second reason why we do this. Immediately following a
scavenge there are likely a large number of grey objects that need
rescanning. The abortable preclean phase tries to deal with such newly
grey objects thus reducing a subsequent CMS remark pause.

The scheduling of 'remark' phase can be controlled by two jvm options
CMSScheduleRemarkEdenSizeThreshold and CMSScheduleRemarkEdenPenetration.
The defaults for these are 2m and 50% respectively. The first parameter
determines the Eden size below which no attempt is made to schedule the
CMS remark pause because the pay off is expected to be minuscule. The
second parameter indicates the Eden occupancy at which a CMS remark is
attempted.

After 'concurrent preclean' if the Eden occupancy is above
CMSScheduleRemarkEdenSizeThreshold, we start 'concurrent abortable
preclean' and continue precleanig until we have
CMSScheduleRemarkEdenPenetration percentage occupancy in eden, otherwise
we schedule 'remark' phase immediately.

secs]**

In the above log, after a preclean, 'abortable preclean' starts. After
the young generation collection, the young gen occupancy drops down from
1040940K to 1464K. When young gen occupancy reaches 522484K which is 50%
of the total capacity, precleaning is aborted and 'remark' phase is
started.

Note that in 1.5, young generation occupancy also gets printed in the
final remark phase.
